abstract = "BACON.3 is a production system that discovers empirical laws. Although it does not attempt to model the human discovery process in detail, it incorporates some general heuristics that can lead to discovery in a number of domains. The main heuristics detect constancies and trends in data, and lead to the formulation of hypotheses and the definition of theoretical terms. Rather than making a hard distinction between data and hypotheses, the program represents information at varying levels of description. The lowest levels correspond to direct observations, while the highest correspond to hypotheses that explain everything so far observed. To take advantage of this representation, BACON.3 has the ability to carry out and relate multiple experiments, collapse hypotheses with identical conditions, ignore differences to let similar concepts be treated as equal, and to discover and ignore irrelevant variables. BACON.3 has shown its generality by rediscovering versions of the ideal gas law, Kepler's third law of planetary motion, Coulomb's law, Ohm's law, and Galileo's laws for the pendulum and constant acceleration."

  abstract={The Windows-Icons-Menus-Pointer (WIMP) interface paradigm dominates modern computing systems. Yet these interaction techniques were originally developed for machines that are now 10, 15, or nearly 20 years old. Human-computer interaction currently faces the challenge of getting past this "WIMP plateau" and introducing new techniques which take advantage of the capabilities of today's computing systems and which more effectively match human capabilities. Two-handed spatial interaction techniques form one possible candidate for the post-WIMP interface in application areas such as scientific visualization, computer aided design, and medical applications. The literature offers many examples of point design, offering only a description of the thing (what the artifact is) and not the process. But point design only provides a hit-or-miss coverage of the design space and does not tie the multiplicity of efforts into a common understanding of fundamental issues. To get past the WIMP plateau, we need to understand the nature of human-computer interaction as well as the underlying human capabilities.}
